# SideScroller
Sidescroller JS module game built for OOP principle practes
Come see my project at : https://cosidescroller.netlify.app/
Use ASDW keys for movement with 'Enter' key for attack
#How It's Made
Vanilla JS modules with HTML5 canvas element. Non commercial use game assets for personal practice only
#What I learned
Creating multiple JS files and abstracting as many parts of the larger game object as possible makes it more easily readable and refactorable 
## Optimizations
Adding instructions for key inputs
adding a restart game button
longer game clock
